## WeighedSiamese

This repository contains Python scripts to prepare dataset and train a weighed and unweighed siamese networks. We adapted codes from [Storing NifTi as a TFRecord repository](https://github.com/psadil/psadil/blob/main/content/post/2022-04-23-tf-dataset-from-3d-nifti/index.en.md) for the dataset preparation script.

Pretrained models will be released soon.
