## WeighedSiamese

This repository contains implementation of the Understanding Progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients paper. It includes python scripts to prepare MRI brain images dataset and to train a weighted and unweighted siamese networks. 

We adapted codes from [Storing NifTi as a TFRecord repository](https://github.com/psadil/psadil/blob/main/content/post/2022-04-23-tf-dataset-from-3d-nifti/index.en.md) for the dataset preparation script.

We will release our trained models soon.
