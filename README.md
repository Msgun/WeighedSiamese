## WeighedSiamese

This repository contains implementation of the "Weighted Siamese Network to Predict the Time to Onset of Alzheimer's Disease from MRI Images" paper. It includes python scripts to prepare MRI brain images dataset and to train a weighted and unweighted siamese networks. 

We adapted codes from [Storing NifTi as a TFRecord repository](https://github.com/psadil/psadil/blob/main/content/post/2022-04-23-tf-dataset-from-3d-nifti/index.en.md) for the dataset preparation script.

We will release our trained models soon.
